# Ghosty
After many attempts at writing games in python with pygame, I have finally decided to make a project to the end and not leave it unfinished. <|^_^|>

## The Game
The game is a 2D platformer (WOW such creativity ! yes I know) about a soldier and a ghost. It is all about the collaboration of powers between the two different characters, where each has his unique 
abilities. They will need to cooperate to free a person who was captured by the horrible government of Arstotzka in a concentration camp. The game is made of levels with an increasing difficulty and more and more challenges.

## What I still want to implement
- BASICS I WILL DO FIRST:
    - Add a menu
    - Add collision with enemies

- ADVANCED STUFF:
    - When an enemy dies, its fantom could be used in some way (haven't figured out what yet)
    - Add some secret doors to enter into secret levels
    - Write the story and make some animations
    - Add a second part to the game where you enter the prison and go into infiltration mode

- STUFF RELATED TO THE INFILTRATION PART OF THE GAME:
    - Add some behaviour to enemies, like have dialogs or call some help
    - Add some cameras
    - Add some lasers
    - Make the player use knives instead of guns, f.i. because he would be discovered
    - Add an end to the game

- ART STUFF:
    - Redo the drawings and draw them better
    - Do some musics and sound effects
    - Draw some backgrounds and ambience draws
    - Try to learn how to draw better
    - Write some dialogs, including some private jokes with some of my friends

- SEARCH FOR MORE IDEAS

IF YOU HAVE A SUGGESTION OF WHAT I COULD ADD, I WOULD REALLY BE GLAD IF YOU WERE TO TELL ME ABOUT IT ^_^
