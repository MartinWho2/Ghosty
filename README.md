# Ghosty
After many attempts at writing games in python with pygame, I have finally decided to make a project to the end and not leave it unfinished. <|^_^|>

## The Game
The game is a 2D platformer (WOW such creativity ! yes I know) about a soldier and a ghost. It is all about the collaboration of powers between the two differents characters, where each has his unique 
abilities. They will need to cooperate to free a person who was captured by the horrible government of Arstotzka in a concentration camp. The game is made of levels with an increasing difficulty and more and more challenges.
