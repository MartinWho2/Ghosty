HERE IS A LIST OF SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS I'M THINKING OF FOR THIS GAME
- BASICS I WILL DO FIRST:
    - Add a menu
    - Make the button also reactivate doors
    - Add collision with enemies

- ADVANCED STUFF:
    - Add an automated tower which can be switched on/off like a door
    - Add some moving platforms
    - When an enemy dies, its fantom could be used in some way (haven't figured out what yet)
    - Add some secret doors to enter into secret levels
    - Write the story and make some animations
    - Add a second part to the game where you enter the prison and go into infiltration mode

- STUFF RELATED TO THE INFILTRATION PART OF THE GAME:
    - Add some behaviour to enemies, like have dialogs or call some help
    - Add some cameras
    - Add some lasers
    - Make the player use knives instead of guns, f.i. because he would be discovered
    - Add an end to the game

- ART STUFF:
    - Redo the drawings and draw them better
    - Do some musics and sound effects
    - Draw some backgrounds and ambience draws
    - Try to learn how to draw better
    - Write some dialogs, including some private jokes with some of my friends

- SEARCH MORE IDEAS

IF YOU HAVE A SUGGESTION OF WHAT I COULD ADD, I WOULD REALLY BE GLAD IF YOU WERE TO TELL ME ABOUT ^_^
